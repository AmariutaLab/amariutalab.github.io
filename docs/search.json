    "text": "IMPACT\nWe previously developed IMPACT, a machine learning model that predicts cell-type-specific regulatory element activity using master regulator transcription factors as anchors (Amariuta et al., 2019, American Journal of Human Genetics). IMPACT leverages more than five thousand epigenetic experiments across diverse cell types to describe the epigenetic patterns at the sites of actively bound transcription factors.\nWe have now computed the IMPACT regulatory element score across all ~3 billion base pairs of the genome for each of 707 unique transcription factor-cell type pairs. Using the UCSC genome browser, you can now query regions, genes, or DNA mutations of interest and visualize the predicted regulatory element activity across different cell types. This can reveal the cell types in which genes may be specifically expressed or the mechanisms that mutations are specifically perturbing.\nClick here to get started!\nFor more information on the development of IMPACT and resulting predictive models, please navigate to the Tools Section of our website.\n\nViewing Transcription Factor-Specific Activity\nYou may collapse or expand information across different IMPACT tracks from the same general tissue or cell type category to reveal consensus regulatory element activity (darker colors) compared to transcription factor-specific activity (lighter colors). By default IMPACT tracks are collapsed across models that share the same cell type, but are characterized by different transcription factors. To expand IMPACT tracks, click anywhere in the middle of the track, identify the Overlay Method option and select None from the drop-down menu. You may also select specific transcription factor tracks of interest by (de)-selecting the IMPACT tracks in List Substracts. The ID number for each track corresponds to the ID number assigned to the IMPACT track in the publication."

We are specifically interested in fine-mapping disease genes and their cell types of action, with the goal of finding targets for gene-based therapeutics.\n\n\nResearch Interests\nCurrently, health-related discoveries from the field of human genetics disproportionately benefit individuals of European descent, due to the longstanding Eurocentric bias in data collection and study design. I am particularly motivated to work with ancestrally diverse patient cohorts and develop statistical genetics methods that can be applied to data from multiple populations; most methods have only been applied to European populations and cannot be applied to more than one population at a time.\nI am generally interested in studying the complex nature of the genetic susceptibility of human disease and phenotypes. The precise biological mechanisms through which genetic variation is mediated to impact complex traits and diseases remain largely uncertain. I am interested in studying intermediate phenotypes such as gene and protein expression, while also understanding how environmental factors can modulate genetic risk. My previous work has approached these questions from a population genetics perspective, leveraging large biobank data, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the UK Biobank and Biobank Japan, consortium-level functional data, such as from ENCODE, and gene expression studies, such as from GTEx.\n– Tiffany Amariuta, Principal Investigator"
