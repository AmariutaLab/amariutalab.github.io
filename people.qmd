### Computer Science & Engineering Ph.D. Student

Ishaan is a Ph.D. Student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. He is driven to improve our ability to predict immune responses and disorders in patients, as well as studying how sequence-to-function models can be used to understand the implication of genetic variants in disease. For one project, he is currently using gene expression prediction models to find causal cell types and states in autoimmune disorders and immune cell mechanisms. Another one of his projects is evaluating the potential contributions diploid-formatted inputs may provide to sequence-to-function models. In his free time, Ishaan loves to try food and recipes from across the globe or going hiking.
